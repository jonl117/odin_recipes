    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chili, or chili con carne (chili with meat) to the purists, is far more than just a stew; it is a culinary tradition and a global comfort food champion. While its precise origins are hotly debated Texas proudly claims it, but indigenous stews using chilies predate the Lone Star State the dish as we know it took shape in the American Southwest. It is a beautifully simple concept: a savory base of meat usually beef simmered for hours with chilies, garlic, onion, and spices like cumin and oregano. Traditionally, it contains no beans a point that can spark a friendly feud among chili aficionados but over time, variations including beans, tomatoes, and even unexpected additions have become equally beloved across kitchens everywhere.</p>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in crockpot or dutch oven over medium or medium-high heat. Once heated brown ground beef until no pink spots are visable.</li>
        <li>Once done drain the beef and toss in the onion. Cook until golden, once the onions start sweating scrap all the brown bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Throw in the bell peppers and any other peppers used, cooking until they soften.</li>
        <li>When the peppers are done add the garlic for a minute, ensuring not to burn it.</li>
        <li>If there is any browning on the bottom of the pot deglaze with a little red wine and cook until most is evaporated.</li>
        <li>Toast the tomato paste in center of pot for a minute then combine with the veggies, afterwords add in the tomato sauce, beef stock, and drained rotel.</li>
        <li>Once warm add in the beef, beans (make sure to drain liquids), chipotle peppers, and all the seasons to liking. </li>
        <li>Bring to a bubble and cover, reducing heat to a simmer. Stir it every 30 minutes, adjusting heat as needed. The longer you let this cook the better it will taste.</li>

        <li>If you want to thicken the chili cook with the lid off until desired thickness. When done squeeze in the lime.</li>
