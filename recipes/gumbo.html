    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

    <p>Gumbo is the official state cuisine and an undisputed staple of Louisiana, celebrated for its deep, savory flavor and hearty consistency, which falls somewhere between a thick soup and a rich stew. Its roots are a cultural melting pot, combining influences from African, French, Spanish, German, and Native American cuisines, which contribute to its many celebrated varieties. These range from the tomato based, often seafood heavy Creole gumbo of New Orleans, which may use a lighter roux, to the darker, more robust Cajun gumbo from the state's southwestern region, typically featuring chicken, andouille sausage, and a deeply browned roux for its signature rich, nutty flavor. Whether thickened with okra, filé powder (ground sassafras leaves), or a roux, and regardless of the combination of meats and seafood, gumbo is a revered culinary tradition and a symbol of Louisiana's diverse heritage.</p>

    <p>This specific recipe will guide you through making a classic Chicken and Sausage Gumbo, a comforting and deeply satisfying version particularly popular in Cajun country. We'll focus on building flavor from the ground up, starting with a dark, smoky roux essential for that signature nutty taste and enriching it with the "holy trinity" of onion, bell pepper, and celery. The combination of tender chicken and richly seasoned andouille sausage creates a hearty, well balanced meal, perfect for serving over a bed of rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>*Roux can either be used from a jar or homemade by melting butter in a pot and mixing in flour until the mixture takes on a deep dark brown color.</p>
