    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

    <p>Gumbo is the official state cuisine and an undisputed staple of Louisiana, celebrated for its deep, savory flavor and hearty consistency, which falls somewhere between a thick soup and a rich stew. Its roots are a cultural melting pot, combining influences from African, French, Spanish, German, and Native American cuisines, which contribute to its many celebrated varieties. These range from the tomato based, often seafood heavy Creole gumbo of New Orleans, which may use a lighter roux, to the darker, more robust Cajun gumbo from the state's southwestern region, typically featuring chicken, andouille sausage, and a deeply browned roux for its signature rich, nutty flavor. Whether thickened with okra, filé powder (ground sassafras leaves), or a roux, and regardless of the combination of meats and seafood, gumbo is a revered culinary tradition and a symbol of Louisiana's diverse heritage.</p>

    <p>This specific recipe will guide you through making a classic Chicken and Sausage Gumbo, a comforting and deeply satisfying version particularly popular in Cajun country. We'll focus on building flavor from the ground up, starting with a dark, smoky roux essential for that signature nutty taste and enriching it with the "holy trinity" of onion, bell pepper, and celery. The combination of tender chicken and richly seasoned andouille sausage creates a hearty, well balanced meal, perfect for serving over a bed of rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>*Roux can either be used from a jar or homemade by melting butter in a pot and mixing in flour until the mixture takes on a deep dark brown color.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by putting chicken in a large stock pot and submerging it in water. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer for 20-30 minutes(internal temp should be 165f once done).While chicken is simmering go ahead and dice the onion, celery, bell peppers, and slice the sausage. Once chicken is done strain it, making sure to reserve the stock for later(No waste!). You can shred the chicken now or later when not doing anything.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in stock pot, once melted throw in the flour and whisk continuosly until the roux turns a rich, deep brown. It is important to stir frequently, ensuring the roux doesnt burn.</li>
        <li>Once roux is done add the holy trinity (onions, bell pepper, and celery). Saute until tender.</li>
        <li>Add the sausage, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the seasonings.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken stock and simmer over medium-low heat, occasionally stirring. The longer you let it cook the deeper the flavor profile.</li>
        <li>About 15-30 minutes before you are ready to stop cooking add in the chicken.</li>
        <li>Once done take off heat and serve over rice. Dont forget to top with gumbo file!</li>
    </ol>
